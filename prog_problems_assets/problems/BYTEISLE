BYTEISLE

https://www.codechef.com/problems/BYTEISLE

A long school holiday has come, and you decided to visit the famous Byte
Island. You know there are only two types of Bytelandians: Byteknights and
Byteknaves. A Byteknight always tells the truth, whereas a Byteknave always
lies.

It is known that there are _N_ Bytelandians in the island, and now you meet
all of them. You are curious about their types. Because you are a smart
logician, you don't want to ask them questions that immediately reveal their
types (that's too boring). Instead, to each Bytelandian you ask, "How many
Byteknights are there here?"

To your surprise, they also don't answer your questions directly. Instead, the
_i_-th Bytelandian answers of the form "The number of Byteknights here is
between _ai_ and _bi_, inclusive". You record all answers in your pocket note.

Now that you have collected all information you need, determine the type of
each Bytelandian.

### Input

The first line contains a single integer _T_, the number of test cases. _T_
test cases follow. The first line of each test case contains a single integer
_N_. _N_ lines follow. The _i_-th line contains two integers _ai_ and _bi_.

### Output

For each test case, output two lines. In the first line, output a single
integer indicating the number of different solutions, modulo 1000000007. In
the next line, output the lexicographically smallest solution. A solution is a
string consisting of _N_ characters, where the _i_-th character of the string
is '1' if the _i_-th Bytelandian is a Byteknight, or '0' in case of a
Byteknave. It is guaranteed that there is at least one valid solution.

### Example

    
    
Input:

    3
    1
    0 1
    4
    1 4
    2 4
    3 4
    4 4
    3
    1 2
    0 0
    1 3
    
Output:

    1
    1
    5
    0000
    1
    101
    

### Constraints

* 1 <= _T_ <= 5
* 1 <= _N_ <= 50000
* 0 <= _ai_ <= _bi_ <= _N_
