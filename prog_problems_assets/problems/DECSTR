### Statement

Consider a string of length N consisting only of lowercase alphabets a-z. Let
s[i] be the character at the i-th position in the string (1-based). The string
is a K-string if there are EXACTLY K values of i (1 <= i < N) such that
s[i+1]<s[i] (we assume 'a'<'b'<'c'<...<'z'). Given K, find the
shortest K-string. If there are multiple solutions, find the lexicographically
earliest K-string.

### Input

The first line contains the number of test cases T (1<= T <= 100). Each
test case contains an integer K (â‰¤ 100).

### Output

Output T lines, one for each test case, containing the required string. Use
only lower-case letters a-z.
