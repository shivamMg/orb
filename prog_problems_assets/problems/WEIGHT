WEIGHT

https://www.codechef.com/problems/WEIGHT

### Statement

Let us denote an **n** digit decimal number by a1a2a3...an with the condition
that each ai should be between 0 and 9 inclusive except a1 which should be
between 1 and 9 inclusive. The weight of such a number is defined as the sum
of absolute difference between adjacent numbers. Precisely the weight can be
defined as,  

    
    
    
    	weight = 0
    	For i = 1 to n-1
      		weight = weight + ABS(ai+1 - ai)
    
    
    

Here ABS is the absolute value of the argument.  
Given _n_ and a weight _w_, find all the _n_ digit numbers having a weight
_w_. Since the answer could be very large, print the answer modulo 1000007.  
  

### Input Format:

  
The first line contains one integer **t**, the number of testcases. (1 <=
**t** <= 150)  
This will be followed by **t** lines each consisting of numbers **n** and
**w**.  
  

### Constraints:

  

* 2 <= **n** <= 20
* **0** <= **w** <= 200
  

### Output Format:

  
For each test case print the answer modulo 1000007 in a separate line.  
  

### Sample Input:

  

    
    
    2
    10 0
    2 1
    

### Sample Output:

  

    
    
    9
    17
