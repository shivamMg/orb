Teddy and Tracy like to play a game based on strings. The game is as follows.
Initially, Tracy writes a long random string on a whiteboard. Then, each
player starting with Teddy makes turn alternately. Each turn, the player must
erase a contiguous substring that exists in the dictionary. The dictionary
consists of _N_ words.

Of course, the player that can't erase any substring in his turn loses the
game, and the other player is declared the winner.

Note that after a substring R is erased, the remaining substring becomes
separated, i.e. they cannot erase a word that occurs partially to the left of
R and partially to the right of R.

Determine the winner of the game, assuming that both players play optimally.

### Input

The first line contains a single integer _T_, the number of test cases. _T_
test cases follow. The first line of each testcase contains a string _S_, the
string Tracy writes on the whiteboard. The next line contains a single integer
_N_. _N_ lines follow. The _i_-th line contains a single string _wi_, the _i_-
th word in the dictionary.

### Output

For each test case, output a single line containing the name of the winner of
the game.

### Example

    
    
Input:

    3
    codechef
    2
    code
    chef
    foo
    1
    bar
    mississippi
    4
    ssissi
    mippi
    mi
    ppi
    
Output:

    Tracy
    Tracy
    Teddy
    

### Constraints

* 1 <= _T_ <= 5
* 1 <= _N_ <= 30
* 1 <= |_S_| <= 30
* 1 <= |_wi_| <= 30
* _S_ and _wi_ contain only characters 'a'-'z'
