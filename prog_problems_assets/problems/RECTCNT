Given N separate integer points on the Cartesian plane satisfying: there is no
any three of them sharing a same X-coordinate. Your task is to count the
number of rectangles (whose edges parrallel to the axes) created from any four
of given points.

### Input

There are several test cases (ten at most), each formed as follows:

* The first line contains a positive integer N (N â‰¤ 105).
* N lines follow, each containing a pair of integers (each having an absolute value of 109 at most) describing coordinates of a given point.
The input is ended with N = 0.

### Output

For each test case, output on a line an integer which is the respective number
of rectangles found.

### Example

    
    
Input:

    6
    7 1
    3 5
    3 1
    1 5
    1 1
    7 5
    0
    
Output:

    3
